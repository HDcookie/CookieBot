CookieBot is a bot I'm creating with the goal to sell it as a subscription.  It plans to add clean and fun games and commands inside of discord, among other fun/useful features.

### https://github.com/users/HDcookie/projects/8/views/1

Features already implimented: 
  - Make a sentence 
  - Counting 
  - Guess the number 
  - Truth or dare (dms players to let players creat their own truths and dares)
  - Auto channel description/emoji, when a channel is created it will automatically attempt to add an emoji and a description

### Plans to add in the future:

- Free simple channel games 
  - One message channel, each user gets 1 message in the channel before it gets locked.  
- Daily Questions, polls, challanges, Bible verses, ect.
- Two truths and a lie, reaction role, 1 person with the role at a time gets to make a 2 truth 1 lie
- Same idea with never had I ever, buttons to say Yes or No
- Bible bot features https://biblebot.xyz/
- Custom 24/7 Radio (mostly done, needs to fully implement SQL and multiple server logic)

### Might add in the future:
- Somewhat advanced ticket system with motals
- Mod mail system, makes threads for all the mod mails in specific channel
- Points system (currency/xp, gains points for compleating/winning games.)  (will happen, but will not be focusing on it much)
- Full support for a normal music bot (currently implemented but kinda scuffed).  
- Form mode, where all channels and features are done inside 1 form channel that the bot creates.
