CookieBot is a bot I'm creating with the goal to sell it as a subscription.  It plans to add clean and fun games and commands inside of discord, among other fun/useful features.  

Already implimented: 
  - Make a sentence (Done) 
  - Counting (Done)
  - Guess the number


Plans to add in the future:

- Auto channel description/emoji
- Free simple channel games 
  - One message channel, each user gets 1 message in the channel before it gets locked.  
- Daily Questions, polls, challanges, Bible verses, ect.  

- Two truths and a lie, reaction role, 1 person with the role at a time gets to make a 2 truth 1 lie
- Same with truth or dare, 2 random ppl get pinged w/ diffrent role
- Same idea with never had I ever, buttons to say Yes or No
- Bible bot features https://biblebot.xyz/
- Custom 24/7 Radio (mostly done, needs to fully implement SQL and multiple server logic)

Might add in the future
- Somewhat advanced ticket system with motals
- Mod mail system, makes threads for all the mod mails in specific channel
- Points system (currency/xp, gains points for compleating/winning games.)  (will happen, but will not be focusing on it much)
- Full support for a normal music bot (currently implemented but kinda scuffed).  
- Form mode, where all channels and features are done inside 1 form channel that the bot creates.
